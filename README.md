# Hello! I'm Akshitha 

<a href="https://nezuko.me" target="_blank"><img align="right" src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/771307030404399115/926480303311159307/ezgif.com-gif-maker_6.gif" alt="Nezuko" height="130px"></a>  

My three major interests and passions are Computer Science, Maths, and Music, and I believe that there is a creative fusion between all these disciplines. I engage wholeheartedly in these areas both in my school courses and out of school and hope that I will be able to continue doing so on my chosen course and in the extra-curricular opportunities at university. I'm very passionate about sustainability, cybersecurity, and graphics. I love writing blogs on applications of deep learning and things I learn as a part of the courses I take in my free time.
